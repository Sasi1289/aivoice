# Custom Voice Workaround (Without API)

Since Google TTS doesn't support voice cloning, here's a creative workaround using your own voice recordings.

## How It Works

1. Record yourself saying common phrases
2. Save them as MP3 files
3. App plays your recordings when appropriate
4. Falls back to Google TTS for other responses

## Setup

### Step 1: Create Voice Clips Folder

Already created: `public/voice-clips/`

### Step 2: Record Common Phrases

Record yourself saying these phrases and save as MP3:

**Greetings:**
- `greeting.mp3` - "Oh look, another human who needs my help. How delightful. What do you want?"
- `hello.mp3` - "Hello! I'm Pichi Budamkai, your sarcastic AI assistant."

**Reactions:**
- `thinking.mp3` - "Hmm, let me think about that..."
- `interesting.mp3` - "Oh, that's actually interesting."
- `sarcastic.mp3` - "Oh great, another question. How surprising."
- `confused.mp3` - "I'm not sure I understand what you're asking."

**Responses:**
- `thanks.mp3` - "You're welcome, I guess."
- `bye.mp3` - "Goodbye! Try not to miss me too much."
- `error.mp3` - "Oops, something went wrong. How embarrassing."

### Step 3: Save Files

Save all MP3 files in: `public/voice-clips/`

Example:
```
public/
  voice-clips/
    greeting.mp3
    hello.mp3
    thinking.mp3
    interesting.mp3
    sarcastic.mp3
    thanks.mp3
    bye.mp3
    error.mp3
```

### Step 4: App Will Use Your Voice

The app will automatically:
- Play your voice clips for matching phrases
- Use Google TTS for everything else
- Mix both seamlessly

## Recording Tips

1. **Use a good microphone**
2. **Speak naturally** - don't read robotically
3. **Add personality** - be sarcastic, playful
4. **Keep it short** - 2-5 seconds per clip
5. **No background noise**
6. **Consistent volume** across all clips

## Recording Tools

### Windows:
- Voice Recorder (built-in)
- Audacity (free, advanced)

### Online:
- https://online-voice-recorder.com
- https://vocaroo.com

### Phone:
- Record on phone, transfer to computer
- Usually best quality

## Advanced: Dynamic Matching

The app can match keywords and play appropriate clips:
- User says "hello" → plays `hello.mp3`
- User says "thanks" → plays `thanks.mp3`
- AI response contains "interesting" → plays `interesting.mp3`
- Everything else → uses Google TTS

## Limitations

- Only works for pre-recorded phrases
- Can't generate new sentences in your voice
- Need to record many clips for variety

## For TRUE Voice Cloning

If you want the AI to speak ANY text in your voice, you need:

1. **PlayHT** (₹2,600/month, Indian payments)
2. **Coqui TTS** (Free, requires Python 3.11)
3. **ElevenLabs** (₹4,000/month, USD only)

This workaround is free but limited to pre-recorded phrases.

Want me to implement this workaround? Or would you prefer to:
- A) Try PlayHT for real voice cloning
- B) Install Python 3.11 for free Coqui TTS
- C) Just use Google TTS without custom voice

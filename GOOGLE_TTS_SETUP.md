## Advanced: Adjust Voice Settings

You can customize the voice by editing `server.js`:

```javascript
audioConfig: {
  audioEncoding: 'MP3',
  speakingRate: 1.1,  // 0.25 to 4.0 (1.0 is normal)
  pitch: 1.0,         // -20.0 to 20.0 (0.0 is normal)
  volumeGainDb: 0.0   // -96.0 to 16.0 (0.0 is normal)
}
```
